Join our tunnel guide team and support tours of Victoria Tunnel – the number one thing to do in Newcastle on TripAdvisor.

Our guides lead short 75-minute tours and longer 2-hour tours both for the public and private groups. This role supports our guides with delivery of the tour, but does not need to have full training on the history and content. The Tunnel Support role is focused on tour operations.

Tours are delivered by pairs, and we support our volunteers to buddy up or to lead tours with a range of people, whichever suits them most.

There is also opportunity to get involved in supporting tours for schools and our special event programme – from Halloween and Christmas to stewarding music events and hosting Tipples in the Tunnel. Take a look at our website to see the full range.

The role involves
● Opening and setting up the Tunnel, including health and safety checks
● Organise and hand out hard hats and torches to tunnel visitors
● Bringing up the rear of the tour group to prevent stragglers and help keep the group moving
● Reclaim the torches and helmets, and close down the Tunnel after a tour

Other responsibilities may include:
● Getting involved with our ‘rod squad’ to help maintain the tunnel
● Coming up with ideas and help organise events
● First Aid training

Tunnel Supporters usually volunteer for 2-3 hours at a time. Tours usually last 1¼ or 2 hours and run weekdays, evenings and weekends. Volunteering can be regular or occasional, and willingness to step in at short notice is very much appreciated.

We hope to see Tunnel Supporters on tours at least once a month.

What to do next Complete the form here:

https://ouseburntrust.org.uk/get-involved/volunteer/victoria-tunnel-support/



Or come to one of our Volunteer Drop In tours on the last Thursday of the month.

Skills


Volunteers will need:
● Experience of working with people
● Excellent communication and organisational skills
● The enthusiasm and the ability to work as part of a team.
● Access to email and mobile phone text for tour planning

This role will suit you if you are:
● Someone who enjoys meeting new people
● Keen to learn more about Victoria Tunnel
● You enjoy supporting and being supported by other members of a team
● You want to give your time and enthusiasm to help us preserve this iconic landmark for future generations whilst sharing stories of its past with the visitors of today

The Divest Tyne &amp; Wear campaign brings together local people who are concerned about climate breakdown and want to make a difference.

Our goal is to make a big impact on the driving cause of greenhouse gas emissions – the extraction and burning of fossil fuels – by persuading one of the UK’s biggest council pension funds to stop investing in oil, gas and coal.

A volunteer to support the administration of our campaign planning will strengthen our ability to succeed with this vital campaign.

We will value your help to plan our meetings, prepare minutes, supervise our filing and assist with the management of our correspondence, including our email account.

Every local council taxpayer from the Scottish Border to the border with County Durham has their money flowing into Tyne &amp; Wear Pension Fund because it is the scheme run by the six local councils; the same applies to the pension contributions of more than 180,000 pension fund members in our area. Tyne &amp; Wear Pension Fund investments include tar sands, fracking, controversial overseas schemes and companies increasing their extraction.

These are harming all our futures; changing to less harmful investments will protect our futures.

Many other huge pension funds have switched out of fossil fuels – change for our area is achievable and overdue!

Availability needed:
● approximately two hours per week to monitor the email account and assist with preparation for the Monthly Meeting (such as ensuring reports are in shared folders); the times are flexible to suit the volunteer.
● Three/four hours each month to assist with preparation of the Monthly Meeting Agenda, support the drafting of Minutes, and make contact as needed with campaign organisers to gather key information
● Ideally the volunteer would have a reasonable amount of availability across the year, although a deputy would be provided for holiday and sickness cover.

More information about Divest Tyne &amp; Wear is available at https://southtynesideassembly.org.uk/divest/- this includes links to other outlets.

Our website, mailing list, outreach and social media reach hundreds of people; through them, we seek to share information about events and activities to keep our supporters informed about relevant events and training.

please sent email expression of interest, including a brief outline of reasons for getting in touch and summary of relevant experience

Skills


SKILLS:

WRITING: Basic skills of punctuation, grammar etc are needed; experience of prep of Agendas and Minutes are useful but training can be provided.

FILING: Experience of filing and archiving will be useful, including use of shared folders (however, shared working can be supported through guidance and training)

FORMATS: Familiarity with standard file types will be needed (e.g. Word, Excel)

ONLINE COMMUNICATION: Experience with email management will be valuable, included creation of distribution groups, management of confidentiality, archiving.

RELEVANT EXPERIENCE:
● Familiarity with using laptop to produce documents and manage communications (need not be for professional purposes, personal experience may be very relevant)
● Awareness of and interest in climate issues
● Experience of seeking/checking information

QUALITIES:
● Interpersonal skills (to work remotely with other volunteers in the team)
● Reliable

We regret we are not in a position to reimburse expenses incurred in travelling to and from the centre, but any pre-agreed expenses incurred in the course of your duties will be reimbursed.

This position is entirely voluntary and is therefore unpaid.

Volunteers are asked to help with unpacking and sorting the many books we have donated to Borderline Books from various sources.



The books are stamped and counted as they come in, and then shelved in the appropriate section.

Prison Project



Our prison project also needs people who can learn the process of picking and packing books for prisons up and down the country.

Accuracy is essential, as is absolute confidentiality.



We need to build up the prison team as demand is rocketing – we have already given more than 17,000 books to 116 prisons this year.

Help people in your community to improve their English through the power of reading!

Newcastle Libraries are looking for enthusiastic volunteers who are keen to lead a friendly, fun group where people can read aloud.

Our reading groups are not a substitute for ESOL classes but reading aloud can help improve pronunciation, comprehension and build confidence.

Our Practise English group runs as a drop-in session.  This means that group sizes and reading ability/language skills can vary from week to week.

Your role will involve selecting suitable books from our catalogue for your group to read and facilitating a reading-aloud session with friendly discussion at the end.

This role forms part of Volunteer Passport Scheme Newcastle, to apply to join the scheme please email Pam.Robinson@volunteeringmatters.org.uk

Skills


There is no teaching experience required for this role, only a willingness to be kind and encouraging.



Volunteers must be flexible and able to work with any learner who attends the session, including those attending for the first time. It's essential that volunteers are comfortable supporting learners with any level of English ability including very beginners.

Home from Hospital and Community Support is a project delivered together by Volunteering Matters and Chain Reaction that provides free services for over-55-year-old patients discharged from hospitals in Newcastle. This service aims to help patients return home safely from a stay in hospital.

Joining Home from Hospital is a great way to gain new skills and experience in supporting older people in your local community. You will also be supporting the NHS in its goal to prevent people from being readmitted to hospital. Your contribution will keep older people safe, healthy, independent, and connected to their local community.

The role of a Volunteer Community Responder is to provide social, emotional, and practical support to a patient being discharged from hospital. The tasks that a volunteer may undertake includes:
● Provide assistance to patients collecting prescription or pension
● Accompanying patients to complete essential shopping
● Wellbeing checks / offering emotional support
● Household jobs (e.g. empty bins, ensuring food is in date etc)
● Follow up on welfare calls (via telephone call or face to face)
● Signposting and helping to introduce people to other community activities

Community Responder volunteers assist with tasks that in other circumstances, a neighbour may carry out. It is a fully flexible role, so volunteers assist with the tasks they are more comfortable with, at the hours and days of their convenience. This role is flexibly based across Newcastle, and you will be provided with training, ongoing support, and expenses (e.g., travel).

If you are interested in this role then contact Fran francesca.elliott@volunteeringmatters.org.uk for an informal chat and and application form

Skills

● Excellent people and communication skills- the role involves vulnerable people
● Very well organised
● A confident and positive person, compassionate of others, willing to learn new things and take on advice or suggestions
● Flexibility

The Food Foundation works with a diverse group of food activists from across the UK, campaigning both in their own communities and on a national level for the right of all people to be able to access healthy and affordable food. Our Food Ambassadors have lived or living experience of food insecurity. As experts by experience they use their voices to increase the power of our policy asks, bringing light to the real lives behind research and data.

The Food Ambassador volunteer programme is open to all people with lived experience of food insecurity aged 14 years and up. We are really keen to work with school-aged people who want to campaign on improving accessing to Free School Meals and school food quality.

As part of the Food Ambassador volunteer programme, ambassadors attend events and summits, meet with policymakers, and undertake media interviews. While much of the role can be done in your own community (or even your home), some travel may be needed. We will reimburse travel and subsistence expenses to volunteers in line with our Expenses Policy. We work closely with each ambassador, providing support and training opportunities to aid them in their roles as food activists. We also link ambassadors with other organisations to partake in research and focus groups.

Benefits include:
● Opportunities to speak directly to people in positions of power who can enact change (i.e. parliamentarians) and to take part in national advocacy campaigns
● Space, tools and support to develop campaigns at a local level
● Training and support with skills development (such as media interview skills and facilitation skills)
● Participation in research projects which aim to improve the food system
● The chance to meet other like-minded campaigners from across the UK

Skills


Our Food Ambassadors play a crucial role in raising awareness about food insecurity by sharing their first-hand experiences with the media or policymakers. They either live on a low income currently or have done so in the past, providing a unique perspective on the challenges faced by those affected.

Other than having this lived experience, we have no other criteria. Our team will provide the relevant training and support to fulfil the role.

● Attend events and run stalls such as Pride, county fairs, wellbeing days, University freshers’ fairs, and fundraising events.
● Write blogs posts and get involved on social media about your lived experiences of suicide and mental health.
● Help us to reach your communities by connecting us with groups and organisations you care about.
● Share new ideas: we’re always open to new opportunities to make our communities suicide-safer.

This opportunity is remote. Volunteers can do tasks from their home as well as getting involved in events at a number of locations within the local area and further afield across the North East (if the volunteer is willing/able to travel).

Stroke North is a small independent support group (20 members) started in 2005 to help people who’ve been affected by stroke; both survivors and carers. Stroke North provides a safe place for members to socialise and share their experiences, have fun, and play games and quizzes. The club also goes on outings and has meals together from time to time. There’s a great sense of community within the group.

Stroke survivors may experience impaired mobility caused by weakness of muscles in arm or leg, communication difficulties called aphasia, fatigue, memory loss, or visual impairment.

Meetings are at the Howdon Family Gateway Community Hub, on the second and fourth Friday each month from 1:30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m.

● Keep members safe during activities
● Work as part of a team to provide, as required, support for members to participate in the activities of the club, including:
● Before the meeting starts, help to set up for games or other activities
● Helping to serve refreshments at the start of a meeting
● Assisting members who have stroke related communication or visual problems or arm paralysis, to complete their answer sheet during quizzes
● Have conversations with members during refreshments
● Assisting members to participate during ‘floor games’ by guiding them to aim for targets, collecting balls or equipment and keeping scores for the game.
● Assist members to get to the toilet, but not to assist with toileting, any member who requires assistance at the toilet will have a carer to help them.
● During visits to places of interest, giving assistance to members with impaired mobility to get around by pushing wheelchairs or assisting, as needed, with the use of walking aids.
● Assisting members to collect refreshments during visits to places of interest

This list is not exhaustive but covers the main areas of help required.

Skills

● Ability to work as a member of a team that may include people with physical or emotional impairments caused by stroke
● Patience and the ability to help someone with an impairment to feel valued

● Willing to learn how best to communicate with people with communication problems after their stroke.
● Able to identify potential health and safety risks to members and act to remove the risk e.g. risk tripping from trailing flexes or walking aids, dangers of burn injury when serving hot drinks
● Take account of the Safeguarding policies and report any concerns of potential abuse.

We are seeking a new treasurer because our former treasurer retired in July, aged 93.

Our former treasurer attended club meetings to collect monies for subs, taxi contributions and the raffle, recording the income in the accounts book, these are now in EXCEL Files. He also received and paid invoices for use of the Venue, Taxi provision and settled any accounts incurred for activities, insurance etc.

Should attending bi monthly club meetings be a problem for a new treasurer, it would be possible to arrange for another committee member to collect and record the income, bank all monies and provide a record of the transactions to the treasurer.

The treasurer provides a financial report at each meeting of the Management Committee and Annual Accounts for the AGM, reporting the Annual Accounts to the Charity Commission.

Grant applications are made by the current secretary, with the support of the Treasurer, formerly the Chair, he has made a number of applications for Grant Funding through the Community Foundation and the Big Lottery Community Fund.

It would be helpful if a new treasurer could take this responsibility on.

As a fundraising volunteer, we will support you every step of the way to ensure your time at Cats Protection is a positive and rewarding one. Every penny counts when it comes to improving the lives of the thousands of cats and kittens across the UK that need our help each year. Our collection box fundraising volunteers help our volunteer groups raise vital funds by collecting and distributing collection boxes in their local area. Making a difference can mean as little as raising 20p, which is enough to feed one cat in our care for a day, to £150 which is the average cost of a cat in our care.

What can I expect to be doing?
● Overseeing the collection and delivery of collection boxes in different locations
● Recording donations and thanking local businesses and supporters
● Researching local areas for collection box ‘hot spots’
● Sharing fundraising ideas with other volunteers and putting these into practice
● Sharing your passion for cat welfare and promoting the work of Cats Protection
● Engaging with your local branch and Fundraising Hub and feeling like an integral part of the team.

Skills


Due to the larger geographical area that Cats Protection Northumbria covers, it would be desirable to have a full UK driving license.

We're looking for someone with:
● Sympathy to cats and our values
● Happy to be part of a team of dedicated volunteers and employees.
● Flexible and adaptable to different events/activities
● Open to new ideas and ways of fundraising

Assistant Cadet Leaders support our well established Cadet Programme under the supervision of the unit Cadet Leader. This rewarding role will develop your leadership skills, allow you to inspire our cadets, supervise them in their duties, and ensure the smooth running of our weekly sessions. You’ll get involved in various activities and events, ensuring our scheme is the best it can be in representing our local community.

Assistant Cadet Leaders will support the Cadet Leader in leading the Cadet Unit. This will include supervising and supporting the cadets during sessions and events, dealing with issues, and providing a high-quality service to the public. You will be a role model and inspiration to young people, sharing new experiences and helping them to learn more about themselves and what they are capable of. You’ll get to meet lots of different people, some of them from the local community, others from the Northumbria Policing family.

There’s also an opportunity to get involved in the running of the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, supporting the development of individual cadets, and identifying areas in which we can improve.

There are six Cadet Units throughout the force area: one in Northumberland, North Tyneside, Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland, and South Tyneside. In addition to attending weekly cadet sessions, training days and cadet events will be held at various locations across the force area which you may be asked to participate in. Some national activities may also take place across the country.

Skills


You don’t need to come from a policing background to join us! Experience of working with young people (whether that be through a previous volunteer role or in a professional capacity) is beneficial, but is not a requirement for the role.

You need to have a good level of resilience and patience, as our cadets are between the ages of 13 – 18 years old. We want to provide a great service to our young people; therefore, you’ll need to be passionate about helping others and able to communicate effectively. Cadets are regularly active in external community events, and therefore organisational and planning skills are essential to ensure you can support the Cadet Leader. If you have these skills, we’ll ensure you receive support and training from experienced officers and staff that will help you become a great Assistant Cadet Leader.

You should be at least 18 years of age and must live within reasonable travelling distance to the Cadet Unit.

About the role

The Marie Curie Companion Service is a professional service provided by trained volunteers who offer one-to-one companionship and support to people with a terminal illness and their families. The service would not be able to reach those most in need if it was not for the commitment and hard work of the volunteers delivering the service. Companion volunteers provide companionship and emotional support, practical support, short breaks for carers and help with signposting for information and support. These sessions can take place both in person and over the phone.

What you will be doing

Your role will include some of, but not be restricted to, the following tasks:
● Carry out weekly visits with the person(s) you’re supporting, as agreed with the Volunteer Co-ordinator. This could be in a variety of settings, e.g. family home, a care home or in the community.
● Provide one-to-one companionship and support. For example:
● Offering a listening ear and spending time engaging in every-day conversation, activities or hobbies with the person you are supporting.
● Driving clients to pre-arranged health or social care (e.g. to medical appointments) or taking short trips out.
● Helping with small, daily tasks, e.g. making tea or accessing the internet.
● Allowing carers to have a short break.
● You may be supporting your client’s family or carers before or during bereavement. This may involve offering emotional support, signposting to relevant local support services or finding out information as requested

(This is only an outline as support will vary according to individual needs. Companion volunteers do not provide nursing or personal care, or offer counselling or advice)
● Keep your manager informed of any changes to the situation, or any significant happenings in connection to the person you’re supporting and/or their family, either in person or by phone
● Submit regular visit reports to your manager and update relevant computer systems as required
● Be reliable and committed to regularly spending time with someone and offering support
● Attend individual sessions with your Volunteer Co-ordinator, training and group events as required
● Represent the Marie Curie Companion service positively to those using the service

Skills

● Commitment and reliability - able to keep appointments and volunteer for about 3 hours a week
● Patience, empathy and emotional stability
● An understanding of the importance of confidentiality
● Respect for an individual’s privacy, dignity and independence
● Willing to be flexible to the needs of the individual
● Ability to operate within the boundaries of the role

Role requirements

Acting as a representative of Blood Cancer UK in the local community, you will help raise money for our life-saving research by creating fundraising opportunities in your local area and being a local champion by raising awareness of our work and research.

The role is extremely varied; one month you could be hosting a quiz night, the next speaking to local businesses who may be potential partners or holding your own event. The options are limitless. This varied and flexible role enables you to focus on the things you enjoy most, the connections you already have, and the time you have available. Please note the minimum age for this role is 18 years old.

Background

Every year over 40,000 people are diagnosed with blood cancer in the UK. The single best way to beat blood cancer is through research to improve treatment. And the more of it we fund, the more breakthroughs we will see, and the more lives we will save.

Blood Cancer UK Community Fundraising Volunteers play a vital role in strengthening our reach and engagement in local communities - raising awareness of our research, health information, and support.

You will develop new skills, expand your knowledge, and make a significant contribution to improving the lives of people with blood cancer by helping raise vital funds through fundraising activities. The more events we host, the more people affected by blood cancer we can reach and the more funds we can raise. You'll be part of a large team of dedicated and passionate Community Fundraising Volunteers to help us achieve this goal.

Key activities
● Organising your own fundraising events and activities such as quiz nights, music events, luncheons, and supper clubs.
● Attending local community events such as fetes and festivals, selling arts and crafts, baked goods or organising games such as tombolas.
● Submitting applications to host bucket collections at local venues.
● Encouraging others in your network to volunteer their time to support your collection.
● Attending and supporting bucket collections in your local area.
● Greeting the public and speaking about the work of Blood Cancer UK.
● Encouraging people to donate and signposting them to our services.
● Paying in all donations received either online, at Barclays Bank or at your local post office.
● With support from your Volunteer Manager carrying out risk assessments for your fundraising events and activities.

How will I be making a difference?

The funds you raise as a Community Fundraising Volunteer will help to beat blood cancer by investing in research that:
● develops cures for those who have blood cancer, now or in the future,
● continually improves the treatment and care for those living with blood cancer today and,
● aims to stop blood cancer before it starts.

Every penny you raise will make a BIG impact on our vital work:
● £100 could fund a researcher to analyse 120 blood cell samples – any one of them could hold the key to a new discovery.
● £210 is enough for us to send expert patient information to everyone diagnosed with blood cancer today.
● £500 could fund a research nurse for three days – ensuring patients have a hand to hold while testing new treatments.

What will I get out of it?
● You will make a difference to the lives of people affected by blood cancer.
● The chance to represent Blood Cancer UK in your community.
● Practical experience in organising and hosting charity events.
● Opportunity to learn and develop new skills.
● Regular updates from us demonstrating the impact of your support and the difference you’re making to the lives of people affected by blood cancer.
● Be part of a friendly, supportive, and passionate team.
● The opportunity to join an inclusive and diverse organisation, where you will be valued and respected.
● Improved wellbeing and confidence.
● Opportunity to connect with other volunteers.

We need:
● Between 3-15 walk leaders for each city.

● A DBS check, or similar credentials depending on location.

Each volunteer will receive:

Are you passionate about your community? Do you want to unlock the potential of local people and create opportunities for them?

By joining a WEA Local Advisory Panel, you could play a critical role in helping the largest adult education charity in the UK understand local need and do just that.

Many think technical skills and higher education are the solution to their community’s challenges. But approachable, friendly education in core employability and community engagement skills could just unlock the confidence, team-working, talent and interest of local adults and are just as important.

The WEA’s mission is to bring adult education in reach of everyone who needs it, fighting inequality and promoting social justice.

We believe in creating opportunities. You could help us understand and respond to the areas of greatest need local to you.

What is in it for you?
● Influence and impact: Your ideas and recommendations will directly shape our strategies and initiatives and unlock the potential of local people, service-users, future and current employees. You can help us do our life-changing work even better!
● Networking: Connect and collaborate with like-minded experts, forming valuable relationships that can open doors to new opportunities.
● Professional growth: Develop your knowledge of the education sector and fine tune your ability to advise, negotiate, collaborate with and consult multiple stakeholders.
● Recognition: Your valuable contribution will be acknowledged and celebrated. You will also receive access to the WEA’s award-winning lecture series, with a 12-month membership of the WEA.

Skills


What we are looking for:
● Passionate individuals: We seek individuals who are deeply passionate about the success of their local community or business and the importance of education to achieve this.
● Diverse perspectives: We believe that the power of collective wisdom lies in embracing diversity. We welcome individuals from various industries, backgrounds, and cultures.
● Expertise: We particularly value prior experience of WEA learning, but this is not essential. Experience in the following would be hugely valuable too: Work in the education, voluntary or public sector, business or commercial, fundraising or marketing, finance or law, HR or learning &amp; development.
● Collaborative Spirit: We are keen to recruit those able to work effectively within a team, listen actively, and constructively contribute to discussions.
● Active advocacy: We are looking for people with an interest in forging meaningful and productive connections with community organisations, employers and local leaders to advance the WEA’s mission to bring education in reach.

What do Dolphin-spotting, storytelling, wedding reception hosting, artist exhibitions, sea shanties and local history all have in common?

They’re all activities and events that could be happening on a regular basis at the Watch House with a little help from you.

Ever walked past and thought "Wow! What a fantastic distinctive building, steeped in local history, I’d love to see it properly open develop into its full potential as a thriving community venue. Wouldn't it be amazing to see peoples' eyes light up as they experience the same view out the windows as those watching for the return of their friends and families fishing boats did when the building first opened in 1879"?If you want to make a big difference to our local coastal community and help make this happen, now’s your chance! The potential for what this building could be offering is enormous.

Our existing trustees have already embarked upon an ambitious plan for restoring the building into the inspiring community venue it’s crying out to be. We consulted the local community on what activities they’d like to see, achieved funding for a condition survey and heritage statement from a listed heritage architect (it’s a Grade II listed building), and restoration work is now well underway to bring this special building back to its original splendour whilst bringing it up to the standards of modern usage.

Now, we need a dynamic new Chair of Trustees to lead us into our next phase of evolution, to help us gain the funding needed to develop a programme of events and diversify our user groups - so even more local people and visitors from farther afield can enjoy what this magnificent local landmark has to offer. The future’s bright, and we need your help to make it happen as part of our growing team.

Skills

● Support fundraising efforts and identify new opportunities for income generation.

● Keep up-to-date with developments in the charity sector, including changes to legislation and best practice.

● Act as an ambassador for the charity, representing it at external events and engaging with the media.

Requirements

● A commitment to the charity's mission and values.

● Experience in a similar role, such as a chair or board member of a non-profit organisation.

● Strong leadership and management skills, with the ability to motivate and inspire others.

● Excellent communication and interpersonal skills.

Corporate Volunteering Information – West End Women and Girls Centre’s Farm

West End Women and Girls Centre has a beautiful, remote farm in rural Northumberland. Come and help us grow organic free food for our local community, look after our goats, sheep, hens and bees, plant trees and hedgerows, a food forest and create wildlife areas for women and girls!

We are able to take mixed groups from 5 people-50 people. All volunteer days take place at Fallowlees Farm, NE61 4LH.

We ask that all groups of Corporate Volunteers fundraise to support our work. We ask that each group raise £200 which is vital to ensure that we can continue to provide free healthy organic produce and access to the wilds for women and girls from the West End of Newcastle.

To arrange a corporate volunteer day, please contact our Farm Development Manager, Jill on jill@westendwomenandgirls.co.uk

Hear from our Corporate Volunteers!

“Firstly, what a fantastic charity, supporting women and girls. We at Greggs thoroughly enjoyed our day at the farm, digging the area for the pizza oven, planting for harvest time and Christmas dinner. We would absolutely recommend if you want to do your bit for the community whilst incorporating a great team build for your teams. A real great feel good day and brought everyone together supporting each other to complete the work we set out to do.

Jill, Huffty and the team are a real inspiration to us all who really appreciate anything you can do to support the growth and development of the farm. A great day was had by all!” Sue Wildgoose,

Greggs Retail Management Team.

A Typical Volunteer Day

10:00-11:00 – Introduction and hot beverages

11:00-12:30 – Volunteer Work – recent work that volunteers have assisted with includes planting hundreds of spring bulbs, building vegetable beds, digging a trench for our pizza oven, fixing fencing and guttering and planting a Christmas Dinner and pumpkin patch for our members.

12:30-13:15 – Lunch break – the Farm is based in rural Northumberland with no access nearby to shops so we ask that you bring packed lunches.

13:15pm-14:45 – Volunteer Work

14:45pm-15:30 – Tour of the Farm – this will be an opportunity to hear about all the work we do and have a chance to meet and feed our goats, sheep and chickens!

Admission Appeals

When parents or guardians do not receive a place at the school they have applied for they are able to appeal the decision to refuse the place. The parent or guardian give reasons as to why they are appealing the decision and the Admission Authority give reasons as to why they have refused the application for a place. An independent Panel of at least 3 people is arranged to hear the case from both parties and make a decision, based on the evidence provided, as to whether the child should have a place at the school.

Independent Review Panels

When a child has been excluded from a school the Governing Board for that school review the Headteacher’s decision to exclude. If the parent or guardian is unhappy with how the Governing Board reviewed the decision, they can ask for an Independent Panel to review the Governing Board decision. A Panel of at least 3 people is arranged to hear the case from the School, Governing Board and the family and make a decision, based on the evidence provided, as to whether the exclusion decision should be reconsidered.

We are seeking people who are willing to be an independent Panel Member to support these hearings. You would offer your time to attend the hearing itself, which could be held face to face in Newcastle or held remotely on Zoom or Teams.  In the hearing you would listen and ask questions of the different parties regarding the cases presented. You would then make a decision with your Panel Member colleagues based on the evidence presented from all parties.

There is an expectation that you would spend some time reading the hearing papers before attending on the day, however your role would finish once the final decisions had been made.



1 Admission Appeal Hearing takes around an hour, and an Independent Review Panel around 2.5 hours. Often Admission Appeal Hearings are grouped together so you could hear a few in a morning, afternoon, or full day.  Hearings will be carried out in line with the DfE ‘School Admission Appeals Code’ or the ‘Suspension and Permanent Exclusion from maintained schools, academies and pupil referral units in England, including pupil movement’ documents.



Face to face hearings take place at Mansion House Jesmond or Civic Centre, Newcastle.

Remote hearings are held over Zoom or Teams.

Skills


We are seeking people from education and non-education backgrounds, but with a general interest in the education of children. Members should have these skills:
● Impartiality
● Be able to analyse information
● Be able to actively listen &amp; confidently ask questions of all parties
● Be able to reach an informed decision based on information provided.
● Excellent communication and interpersonal skills
● A commitment to fairness
● An appreciation of the confidential nature of these Hearings.

In the case of an IRP we appoint a Panel of 3 people – a lay Chair (who has not worked in a school in a paid capacity), a current or former school governor (within the last 5 years for 12 consecutive months), &amp; a current or former Head Teacher (within the last 5 years).

Hearings may be face to face or held remotely. If willing to hear remotely then Panel Members need to have access to a computer or tablet with a camera and microphone and a reliable internet connection. Panel Members must be confident in using Zoom or Teams. Training for the role will be provided.

Why we need your help

Marie Curie recognises that the best way to understand its services is by seeing it through the eyes of the people we support. Feedback from people we care for is critical in telling us what we are doing well and where we can improve.

Through this exciting volunteer role, you will help us understand our services’ quality by listening to the people we support. You will help us by contacting people while they are receiving our services to make sure we are providing our patients and families with excellent care, and if there are issues, to help us nip things in the bud.

This role has the scope for broader conversations with people about their experiences at the end of life. Gaining insight and understanding allows us to ensure we’re there for all people experiencing dying, death and bereavement.



What we need you to do

Your role will include some of, but is not restricted to, the following tasks:
● Speak with patients and families over the phone to complete surveys about their experiences of our care and support.
● Record data accurately, capturing as much as possible in the person’s own words.
● Input feedback data into an online database.
● If comfortable, undertake analysis of data to help us report on themes and trends; what we are doing well and what we can improve.
● Communicate with patients and families how we use their feedback and ideas to improve services, where appropriate.
● Work with the Clinical Nurse Managers to highlight any issues and concerns about the care provided in their services.
● Relay positive feedback to Marie Curie Nursing staff and volunteers.
● If comfortable, conduct semi-structured interviews to understand peoples’ lived experiences of dying, death, and bereavement.

What we can offer you
● An excellent opportunity to build on your skills in a charity environment
● An induction, training, support and supervision in your role
● Agreed reasonable out-of-pocket expenses

To apply for this role, please complete the online application: https://eofb.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_4001/requisitions/preview/5332/?location=Newcastle+Upon+Tyne%2C+Tyne+And+Wear%2C+United+Kingdom&amp;locationId=300000002554354&amp;locationLevel=city&amp;mode=location&amp;radius=50&amp;radiusUnit=MI

Skills


What skills or experience do you need?
● Good communication, listening and people skills.
● The ability to deal with people in a warm, friendly, and sensitive manner.
● Understanding the importance of confidentiality.
● Empathy and an understanding of the needs of people experiencing end of life care issues.

What we ask of you
● To provide two references from non-family members and other relevant documents related to the role
● To keep to all the charity’s policies and guidelines
● To complete an induction and any training related to the role

Felling Volunteer Library (FVL) is a small library, located in a modern Council building (The Hub); cooperative work with other agency colleagues is important, and FVL benefits from the support of the Council departments. At present we have a complement of about 14 volunteers, including three Trustees who lead the governance of the organisation.

FVL works cooperatively with other (outside) local agencies too, and the aim is to attract more of the Felling community to the Hub amd (in particular) to the Library.

We hold seasonal ‘fayres’ and run crafts and ‘RhymeTime’ events for the younger generations; also a Language class, once a week. Volunteers are encouraged to assist with these facilities, according to their own skillsets and wishes.

All volunteers will assist with the opening/closing of the library (depending on the time of your shift).

You will always have at least one other colleague on shift with you, so there is no lack of support.

You will issue/return books to Library members and assist with any queries re. use of the 3 PCs and copier which are available for the public's use. Shelf stacking and ordering are part of the duty, and being ready to advise/assist in almost any type of query which might come from a member - or merely a passer-by. But you will not be left alone to do this; there's always at least one other colleague around to assist.

Skills


Reasonable level of literacy;

A warm and welcoming attitude and presentation;

Awareness of public relations and confidentiality exigencies – eg. GDPR.

Reasonable computer/IT skills – eg. Use of Capita database.

Communication skills – the ability to work as part of a team, with the vision to create a welcoming, inclusive and anti-prejudice mindset.

As a Childline email counsellor (homebased), you’ll respond to emails from young people who have got in touch with Childline about something that’s worrying them, whether it’s bullying, abuse, self-harm or family relationships – you’ll be there to support them.

What you’ll do

You’ll volunteer from home, offering support to children and young people over email. A Childline supervisor will support you to develop and evaluate your skills. After your initial training, you will be able to support young people as well as identify when a child or young person may be at risk, but a supervisor will always be available to speak to, to give you support.

What you’ll get

You’ll receive training to prepare you for the role and a supervisor will be available to speak to and support you at all times during and after your shifts. Every shift includes an online briefing and debriefing alongside other volunteers. Supervisors will also give you regular one-to-one support and online supervision.

What we’ll need from you

Signing up to be a Childline email counsellor (homebased) is a big commitment and requires lots of training so, we do ask people to stay in the role for a minimum of one year. We’ll also need to do some routine safeguarding checks, including an enhanced criminal record check and at least two satisfactory references with at least one covering a period of five years or more with no gaps. It’s nothing to worry about, and we can answer any questions you have about this.

A laptop or PC with a Microsoft Windows 10/11 or Apple MacOS operating system is required with speakers, a USB port for a headset and a webcam along with a mobile phone.

Note: a tablet, smart phone/tv, Chromebook are not suitable. You will need to download a couple of apps onto your laptop/PC to use the NSPCC computer applications and you will be provided with clear instructions. Weekly 4 hour shift

Skills


While we think this role is suitable for a whole range of people, we are particularly looking for those with the following qualities and experience:
● Passionate about helping young people and children
● Great communication skills
● Empathetic and perceptive
● Works well within a team
● Emotional resilience
● Technically competent
● Confident working from home

This role is incredibly flexible – we are still starting up our fundraising team, so at the moment, there are only a few fundraising events planned. I would say it would be once or twice a month at the moment – and mostly over the weekends.

As a charity we rely on funds donated by generous members of the public to continue to help cats and kittens in need.

Our fundraising volunteers are part of a passionate team that help raise funds to help our feline friends in need.

They help plan and deliver exciting and varied fundraising events, which can be anything from craft fairs, cake sales, sponsored abseils – and anything in between!

What can you expect to be doing?
● Helping organise fundraising events in your local area
● Sharing fundraising ideas with other volunteers and putting these into practice
● Sharing your passion for cat welfare and promoting Cats Protection
● Promoting National fundraising initiatives where appropriate

Skills

● Good communication skills
● Confidence in handling money
● Willingness to be part of a team
● Confidence in speaking to members of the public
● Knowledge of local community networks (would be an advantage)

DKMS is a charity dedicated to the fight against blood cancer and blood disorders. We raise awareness, recruit blood stem cell donors to the register and raise funds to help give more people with blood cancer a second chance of life.

We also support patients from day one of their diagnosis, as well as their families and friends who often wish to organise events to encourage more people to join the register.

This is a really positive way to get involved, and help to rally community support and provide hope at a time when it’s so needed

Donor drive volunteers support donor recruitment events to increase the pool of registered stem cell donors.

The more people who join the register, the more lives we can save. Someone is diagnosed in the UK every 20 minutes and every 45 minutes blood cancer takes a life in the UK. For many blood cancer patients, a stem cell donation is their only chance of survival, but only 60% of people diagnosed in the UK find a matching stem cell donor. By assisting at a donor drive, you are supporting us to increase the pool of registered stem cell donors and therefore increasing the chances of someone with blood cancer being given a second chance of life
● Providing a warm welcome to all visitors
● Answering basic questions about the process and commitment involved in registering (training provided)
● Handing out flyers and support with fundraising on the day
● Answer questions about the work of DKMS
● Check registration forms to ensure all relevant data is collected
● Helping to save lives

This role is on an ad-hoc basis depending on the time and date of the Donor Registration events taking place, which includes weekends and evenings, but the hours are flexible and negotiable to suit the volunteer. We will contact you in plenty of time to check your availability on upcoming events.

Skills

● Reliable, organised and meticulous
● Committed
● Warm, friendly and non judgemental
● Able to maintain confidentiality
● A genuine interest and desire to support the work of DKMS team

Do you want to take part in vegan volunteering around your local area?

You can do that – right here at The Vegan Society.

We have an ever-growing Community Network of vegans just like you, who have a passion to volunteer and promote veganism where they live. Every month, our Network choose from a range of outreach tasks.

These could include town centre stalls, writing to a councillor or MP, sharing our campaigns on social media or contacting local businesses.

You're in control of how much or how little you do. We also provide our volunteers with leaflets, banners and workshops so that they are equipped to make the biggest impact possible.

What does the Organiser role involve?
● Every month, you will be sent a collection of tasks to choose from. We create these from our programme of campaigns.
● You would be the point of contact for Advocates in your area, sharing these tasks and coordinating activities, such as stalls and lobbying councillors.
● We will provide you with a campaign toolkit and be in regular contact with you to ensure you have everything you need.
● You will also be invited to our private Facebook group and WhatsApp chat.
● We would expect you to provide any updates from your group and give feedback on each task. It's vital that we measure the impact that we are having, in terms of positive conversations and leaflets handed out.
● You can also give us ideas you have for future outreach tasks or campaigning. Many Organisers find a huge sense of satisfaction, improvement in self-esteem and enjoy the social side of volunteering in this role.
● You will also be responsible for welcoming new Advocates in your area. We will let you know when somebody new applies, and you will help them to get involved with any activities.
● As the main contact for Advocates, this role does require some awareness of safeguarding and data protection procedures and policy.
● You'll also be the health and safety contact for your group.

There will be full training on your role in this, as well as a handbook and ongoing guidance and support.
● As an Organiser, you will ensure any resources or actions undertaken are in line with our branding and messaging guidelines and make sure that Advocates understand this too.

What training and support is available?
● There will be a full induction to the role, with a gradual introduction of new tasks and responsibilities. To start with, we will provide an initial training session to cover the basics of community organising, communication skills and event planning. This will be done remotely from wherever you are.
● Along with this, we will provide a full pack of resources that covers a range of work that we do.
● From there, there will be regular conversations and reviews, where we can discuss other training requirements.
● Staff are always available to Organisers for any questions, via phone or email.

How much time do I need to invest?

You should be able to commit around two days a month to carry out actions, and this is usually spread out across the month.

We also expect timely responses to emails.

When a new Advocate applies to work with you, we would like them to be contacted within seven days.

Skills

● Great organisational skills Experience of coordinating people
● Experience of working to specific dates and deadlines
● Good time keeping
● Ability to work independently
● Ability to motivate people around the topic of veganism
● Ability to stick to branding Ability to read emails in a timely manner and translate tasks into actions quickly
● Ability to report back on activities
● Excellent knowledge of vegan issues
● It would be beneficial for this role to have access to a vehicle, as some actions will involve taking resources to events or visiting MPs’ offices. However, this is not mandatory as the campaign toolkit can be carried in a backpack.

Messaging can differ every month. Part of our mission statement is to ensure people can remain vegan, so you might focus on getting more vegan options available in local businesses.

Or within our Live Vegan for Less campaign, you may share cheap vegan recipes to help people with the cost of living.

When acting as an Advocate, you will use The Vegan Society’s branding and messaging guidelines. Your local Organiser will guide you in doing this, as they hold physical resources and handbooks. You can report any issues and feedback you have to your Organiser.

Stepney Bank Stables is a unique charity which uses horses as a medium to engage young people living in deprived urban areas of Newcastle.

Situated in the vibrant Ouseburn valley, the stables is easily accessed by young people from nearby Shieldfield, Byker and Walker as well as other areas of the city.

Horses are great teachers of kindness, commitment and responsibility.

They dictate an environment of calm, quiet routine which really helps young people who's home and school life may be chaotic. Studies show that spending time with horses reduces cortisol levels. As well as reducing stress, caring for horses and riding is also physically demanding so boosts physical health too. Through volunteering to care for the horses young people gain key skills for work and life such as team work, awareness of safety, communication and negotiation.

We are always looking for adult volunteers who can support our work and also enjoy the benefits of working around our lovely horses and ponies!

We have a variety of jobs which team can complete for a half or full day including painting, cleaning and gardening.

If your team would like to get more hands on with the horses they can also groom, fill hay nets and clean tack!

These are all key tasks which keep our horses healthy, our equipment in good order and our facilities looking smart.

As all volunteers will need to be supervised on site to keep themselves and our horses safe we as for a donation of £150 to cover staff time. Days run usually 9.30-3pm but shorter sessions can be arranged.

Skills

● comfortable around horses
● able to complete physical activities

Could you or your organisation help improve the financial wellbeing of the next generation?

Financial literacy levels in the UK are falling and there is a significant gap between the financial skills of children in disadvantaged areas compared to their more-advantaged peers. Educating children about money breaks down a key barrier to social mobility and makes a real difference to their financial outcomes in adulthood.

RedSTART is a charity which is supporting the next generation to achieve financial security. Since 2012, RedSTART has helped over 45,000 primary school children across the UK to achieve better financial futures.

If you’d like to volunteer at one of our North East workshops you can view dates and locations and sign up here: Volunteers - RedSTART (redstarteducate.org)

No experience is necessary, training is provided, and volunteers work alongside qualified teachers from the schools.

The session itself is between 12 and 2 on Saturday afternoons. The training can vary but overall we try to teach people the basics of mechanics, checking over a bike to see if it's repairable or recyclable. We'll start a session asking you to pick a bike and we'll work through it together to assess what needs to be done. Staff are on hand to teach and help throughout.

Here is how some of our volunteers described their experience: "amazing", "hands-on", "on the job learning". They love "meeting new people with the same interests", "learning new skills" and the "lots of freedom and an element of independence".

The role is open to young volunteers aged 11 - 18.

Skills


Each young volunteer has a different level of skill depending on attendance so we adapt based on who comes in. We like to find out what you'd like to learn and guide you through the process.

We provide a warm meal for the vulnerable of our city 365 days a year. Central to this task are our food prep teams who diligently cook and prepare a 3 course meal every night. Cooking in bulk is a different experience to our own private kitchens but with the support of our existing experienced volunteers anyone can help feed our friends.

The role can involve a range of culinary tasks and we cook a variety of meals including vegetarian options such as curry, pasta bakes and pies.

Ideally our volunteers will have experience cooking for large numbers but it is not mandatory. All we ask is that you approach your volunteering with an awareness of food and kitchen hygiene, and with a strong desire to help and provide for others. Being the foundation of our work can be a very rewarding role.

It is a fabulous way to spend a few hours each week.

● Experience cooking for large numbers is desirable but not mandatory
● Able to follow food and kitchen hygiene procedures

Blind Veterans UK helps vision-impaired ex-Servicemen and women to rebuild their lives after sight loss. We provide rehabilitation, training, practical advice, and emotional support to veterans regardless of how or when they lost their sight.

We’re here to help blind veterans regain their independence and live the life they choose.

Volunteer drivers are essential in helping our veterans get from A to B.

Whether it's driving them to appointments, or getting them to one of our lunch clubs, our transport team enable our veterans to do the things they need to do.

This role is ideal for someone who likes driving and getting out and about and can make our veterans feel at ease along the journey. It’s simple: arrange pick up, let the veteran know the journey details, take them to the destination, and help them enter and exit the vehicle.

Job done!

Volunteers must be over the age of 18 years and understand the importance of confidentiality and relationship boundaries.

The role can be flexible around your other commitments, but we ask that you are reliable and punctual for our veterans.

You will be fully trained and supported so you feel comfortable and confident in your volunteering.

Our weekly café runs along the Deaf OAP club, and its members are our main group of customers at the time of running of our service.

We are at the point of establishing a new catering team, and our chef Ursula, would like to welcome a new support to our Cafe.

Our volunteering scheme is based on pathways, and our current volunteers will soon be moving on to the next pathway (often FE and HE in catering, social care or nutrition).

It is an exciting time to join our catering team, that we are certain would thrive under the guidance and training of our professional chef

Skills


No prior catering of service experience or qualifications are necessary.

The qualities we seek are to be willing to learn and be receptive.

● Household jobs (e.g. empty bins, ensuring food is in date etc)
● Follow up on welfare calls (via telephone call or face to face)
● Signposting and helping to introduce people to other community activities

Community Responder volunteers assist with tasks that in other circumstances, a neighbour may carry out. It is a fully flexible role, so volunteers assist with the tasks they are more comfortable with, at the hours and days of their convenience. This role is flexibly based across Newcastle, and you will be provided with training, ongoing support, and expenses (e.g., travel).

We are a global Christian organisation leading the fight against leprosy. Following Jesus Christ, we seek to bring about transformation; breaking the chains of leprosy and empowering people to attain healing, dignity and life in all its fullness. Everything we do is focused on our goals of zero leprosy transmission, zero leprosy disability and zero leprosy discrimination.

We deliver talks across the UK and are looking for volunteer speakers to champion our work in local community groups and churches in Newcastle, both in person and via Zoom. The purpose of the talks is to encourage fundraising within the groups by bringing awareness of the terrible impact that leprosy has on both individuals and communities. The role is flexible in terms of hours, as we want it to be the best fit for you as you generously offer your skills and time.

Ongoing training, support and resources will be provided by a local member of our Community Partnerships team, and the role is very flexible in terms of hours. We also offer our volunteers expenses and the exciting opportunity to visit our projects overseas.

Skills


The qualities and experience The Leprosy Mission looks for include:
● A clear and audible voice with the confidence to speak publicly
● A passion for the work of The Leprosy Mission
● A willingness to learn about leprosy as a disease and the effects on individuals and communities
● A good understanding of technologies such as Zoom meetings and Microsoft Office
● Internet connection, access to emails and the ability to undertake simple administrative tasks like completing a meeting booking form
● An empathy with Christian ethos of the organisation - We are committed to diversity and welcomes applications from appropriately qualified people from all sections of the community

Across the UK, many cats are cared for by volunteer fosterers who provide a stable, safe and loving environment in their homes or in purpose-built pens in their gardens. They provide vital hands-on care and accommodation to stray or abandoned cats or cats whose owners could sadly no longer keep them, and are part of a dedicated team of volunteers committed to finding new homes for cats in need. Our fosterers carry out this role with support from their local branch or centre.

Most of our fosterers care for one or two cats at a time and enjoy providing lots of TLC to those cats, who have been pre-loved or have had a difficult start in life. Some of our fosterers look after new mums and kittens and provide round-the-clock care to newborns to give them the best start in life.

We deliver a range of adapted sports and activities with a group of adults with learning difficulties every Tuesday at St Andrews URC Church Kenton.

The day runs from 10 am to 3.30pm and we are looking for volunteers to attend between 9.45am and 3.45pm for a full day or 12.45pm to 3.45pm for a half day.

Volunteers will be required to assist staff with setting up the hall, running activities, making drinks and tidying up.

Skills


Although we deliver a number of adapted sports and games NO sporting skills or knowledge are required because the games and activities are all fun based.

There is a small amount of adding up scores for the games.

Good interpersonal skills are essential, plus the ability to interact with and support group members with activities. The group members are very friendly and enjoy meeting new people and getting to know them.

Although experience of Health or Social Care or working with people who have learning disabilities may be advantageous, this is not necessary.

Introduction

The Nepacs youth project is funded by Children in Need, alongside various trusts and community funds from across the north east. The project aims to support young people aged from 8 to 17 years old who have been affected by the impact of having a loved one in prison. A young person may have experienced trauma and feelings of abandonment or become a victim of bullying. As a result, they can become isolated form their peers and struggle to communicate their thoughts and feelings around their own ‘hidden’ sentence. This is where the youth project can step in, to guide young people and offer support and advice to help them to feel positive and more confident about their future.

Overview of the role

Volunteers in this role will provide support, guidance and information to young people who are affected by the imprisonment of a family member. This role will be carried out within prison visitor centres, prison visits halls and through off-site external trips and residentials. Throughout your role, you will be assisted by youth workers, youth project coordinator and sessional staff and will not be expected to take on the sole responsibility for any activities or sessions you do not feel comfortable leading. However, if you feel you would like take on a position with increased responsibility as your volunteering progresses, the youth project coordinator can discuss the opportunities for you to do so, as and where required

Role Description

This youth project volunteer role has different responsibilities attached to it depending on the location you chose to work in and where you feel most comfortable supporting young people. If you would like to take on one or more volunteering roles then this will allow us to provide you with a broader range of experiences and opportunities to help you develop your skills and confidence.

The County Ambassador will assist our Volunteering Coordinator by proactively looking for opportunities to promote the mission and expand awareness of our work. This can be through speaking engagements, which can be in Church groups, Rotary groups, WI, U3A, retirement and community groups or local shows and events.

We would also like you to support our other remote working volunteers, as it can be lonely working as a Tool Ambassador, Community Ambassador, or Champion with little personal contact with TWAM. This role can offer a vital and comforting link for everyone involved. This is a great role for someone with drive, initiative, and passion who wants to use those qualities to transform lives.

What will you be doing?

The County Ambassador will work with our Volunteering Coordinator to:
● Support our team of local volunteers (the people who collect tools, speak on our behalf and represent us in churches and community groups)
● Recruit new volunteers
● Promote our work locally
● Help organise and run local events
● Identify potential collection points or opportunities to establish local groups
● Represent TWAM where opportunities arise

Skills


TWAM is looking for honesty, openness, and someone who will be a credit to a big-hearted compassionate charity. We expect you to be diligent in your role and share our passion for lives transformed through livelihood-creating tools.

Because many speaking engagements come from churches, it is an advantage to be a Christian and essential to be in sympathy with the values and motivation of the Christian community. Please refer to our Core Values which can be found on the website for more information.

This is a great role for someone who likes to show initiative and who shares our passion for livelihood creation. It’s a great role for someone who likes meeting people and getting involved in their community. If this is you, we’d love to hear from you.

When you come and visit The Globe you will find that it is a very welcoming place. That is because it is owned by a community cooperative and run by staff and volunteers dedicated to making music. We run gigs, club nights, music workshops and jam sessions.

We employ some staff, but we could not do all the things we do without a dedicated team of volunteers offering some of their time and expertise for free. They help to run the business and keep our customers and staff safe and enjoying what we do.

Get Involved

Join us as a volunteer. We are particularly interested in individuals who can help run the bar and wish to pick up some valuable skills along the way. Full training will be provided.

As a bar helper, you get to see a wide variety of live acts for free and receive one free drink per event, plus tea/coffee/water.  Take a look at our listings here https://theglobenewcastle.bar/whats-on/

We have a pool of volunteers, so all we are asking is a few hours a month of your time. You know what? You’ll make some new friends too!

Skills


If you have any experience of bar work or till work, that would be welcome because we can get you started more quickly.

But if you have no bar experience but are “good with people” and enjoy various types of music, then we would be happy to train you up.

We welcome any support - the role can be as ad hoc or regular as you like flexible from home and in your local community

Over the last 12 months Tyne Theatre &amp; Opera House has been restoring its Victorian stage machinery as part of a National Lottery funded project.

We are looking for individuals to join a team of volunteers who are being trained to maintain and operate both our under-stage and fly-floor machinery, which includes our demon/grave traps, Thunder Run and the ‘bridges’ and ‘sloats’ that moved the scenery onto stage. More information on the machinery can be found at www.tynetheatreandoperahouse.uk/historic-stage-machinery/

This is a unique opportunity to work with what is one of the only surviving Victorian stage machinery systems in the UK which, in time, we hope to be able to use for demonstrations and potentially for historic performances.

Volunteers will be able to offer as much time as they are able. Practical sessions are likely to be held monthly in the evening (timetable dependant on the theatre programme). Session tasks may include cleaning, repairing, greasing and re-roping parts of the machinery, as well as training in the operation of the traps, sloats and bridges.

The theatre Master Carpenter will support volunteers and be a point of contact for them within the theatre.

Skills


Volunteers should have an interest in learning about heritage and be able to work in a team environment. Please note that this role is fairly physical.

Age UK Gateshead provides our clients with access to exceptional facilities across multiple sites, and one of the key facilities we have, especially in the hotter summer months, is our lovely garden area at House on the Hill in Felling. The garden is fairly large, and provides a pleasant space for our dementia daycentre clients to relax in the sun with a nice cup of tea and a couple biscuits.

With that in mind, we would like a couple volunteer gardeners to help us maintain, and tend to our garden so we can continue to provide the best possible service we can! The role would be completely flexible with regards to when you help out, and for how long. The only key requirement is a decent understanding of plant work, and that you can tell the difference between weeds and flowers.

Skills

● Experienced gardener
● Passion for gardening
● Willingness to undergo additional training provided

We require passionate and committed women to join our volunteer force to help support women survivor(s) of sexual violence.

There are lots of ways to help us raise funds for our work; from bake sales to taking part in the Great North Run, organising a cabaret or building your own bike and cycling it across the USA! We are amazed by everyone who chooses to support us and what they achieve!

Below are some ways to raise funds on behalf of Rape Crisis Tyneside and Northumberland.

Take part in one of our events

We often hold fundraising events, from Firewalking to Abseiling, Art Auctions and Outdoor Survival. You can make sure you are kept informed by signing up for our e-bulletin.  You can choose the types of information we send you when you sign up.

Hold your own event

Many people choose to hold fundraising events on our behalf, for which we are very grateful. If you are keen to do this, please let us know, and we can support you with logos, leaflets, posters, sponsor forms and information.

Community Fundraisers help RCTN stay open! They’re the ones out there helping generate income to help keep our services running. This includes organising events, such as quizzes, tombola, and comedy gigs.

Skills


We are looking for women with a feminist perspective on sexual violence who understands the importance of empathy, confidentiality, and handling sensitive personal data. We particularly welcome volunteers from black and minoritised women, members of the LGBTQ community and / or women with disabilities.

Community fundraisers need a full day of training. This would be a great volunteer opportunity for those wanting to work in charity work / business / events planning / marketing.

Could you or your organisation help improve the financial wellbeing of the next generation?

Financial literacy levels in the UK are falling and there is a significant gap between the financial skills of children in disadvantaged areas compared to their more-advantaged peers. Educating children about money breaks down a key barrier to social mobility and makes a real difference to their financial outcomes in adulthood.

RedSTART is a charity which is supporting the next generation to achieve financial security. Since 2012, RedSTART has helped over 45,000 primary school children across the UK to achieve better financial futures.

If you’d like to volunteer at one of our North East workshops you can view dates and locations and sign up here: Volunteers - RedSTART (redstarteducate.org)



Skills


No experience is necessary, training is provided, and volunteers work alongside qualified teachers from the schools.

As a rainbow call companion, you will be a member of the LGBT+ community who wants to support lonely older LGBT+ people. Your regular calls will provide a lifeline of friendship to our older people. The regular warm, friendly chats and companionship are a vital link with the outside world from which they have become isolated.

Over time, you and the older person you have been matched with will get to know each other well and together you will share fun, laughter and stories.

Tasks include:
● Calling the older person, you have been matched with two to four times a month at an agreed time
● Following the guidance in your call companion training modules to ensure that your calls are enjoyable, appropriate and in line with our charitable aims
● Keeping in regular contact with your call companion coordinator and letting them know how everything is going
● Completing monthly online reports about your call companion calls

Skills

● This is a flexible, homebased voluntary role that can easily be fitted in around your own lifestyle and availability
● Rainbow call companions call the older person they are matched with between two and four times per month, and each call lasts around 30 minutes. During your first call with the older person, you will decide together how often the calls will take place and at what time
● This is a long-term voluntary role, so we are ideally looking for individuals who are able to commit to volunteering with us for at least 12 months
● Please note that you must identify as LGBT+ and be at least 18 years old to volunteer as a rainbow call companion

There are three main roles for the Tool Collector

1. Tool Specialist: the people on the frontline who unload the vans and sort the tools into different trades ready for refurbishing.

2. Tool Refurbisher: the people who refurbish the tools - from grinding off rust to servicing sewing machines, wiping computer hard drives to PAT testing. The list just goes on

3. Tool Kit Creator: the people who put all the tools together in the trade kits.

We are Looking for someone to ideally help out in all areas and be prepared to help where most needed.

We are also need someone willing to train in a speciality area such as PAT testing or sewing/knitting machine servicing. If you have a particular interest or skill, we will do our best to match that to your volunteering opportunity.

We provide training and you will be made very welcome in the team you volunteer with. You will be supported by the Refurbishment Centre Manager and have somebody to turn to at all times during your volunteering.

Skills


Tool Collectors need to work well in teams and have an attitude of "I'll help where I can". We need friendly people who want to fit into a team. Flexibility is key and means there will never be a dull moment!

If you have a knowledge of tools, or relevant training that would be great. But all we need are people who have the physical ability to lift and work with tools. All else we can teach you.

The main role of a Volunteer Speaker is to speak publicly on behalf of TWAM and be our public face in their locality. This will mean receiving invitations from a variety of groups wanting a volunteer speaker to talk about TWAM.

Talks can be from 10 minutes to 40 minutes long and may include a Q&amp;A session. Please don't worry as we will not ask you to speak at a meeting you are not confident to attend.

Groups such as Rotary, U3A, and WI ask for talks about TWAM. We also work with many Churches who ask us to speak at Church Services and Mid-week meetings (we will only ask a Christian comfortable with this setting to speak at Churches).

We will provide talks and presentations that you can use, and for our busiest ,Volunteer Speakers  we can also provide projectors and screens.

We ask our Speakers to try and get their own meetings as well as waiting for those referred by us. An email or phone call to a local group will often lead to an invitation.

Skills


This is a great role for a confident speaker who wants to share our passion to transform lives through skills training and tools.

You'll need access to transport, and if you use your car, legally we will also need to check you have adequate motor insurance and your car has an MOT.
● You need to be able to speak eloquently, clearly and passionately about our work
● You need to be able to engage with people and inspire them to support TWAM

We have a large community garden which is available to members of the public to access as well as our Pre-school service which we operate.

This space is difficult to maintain to the standard we would like. There are many tasks that would help us offer the space we would like including:
● Grass cutting
● Weeding
● Cutting back
● Planting
● Developing areas of the garden for a specific need
● Cleaning of hard surfaces
● Fence painting

Skills


No skills required as we have a long-term volunteer who can advise others on how to carry out tasks and safe ways of working, however the post holder will need to be able to work unsupervised as a large proportion of the role will be lone working.

It would be desirable if volunteers had experience of general garden maintenance.

HostNation believes every refugee deserves a friend. We connect those offering friendship with those needing it.

Befriending is a chance to reach out as willing volunteers to give marginalised refugees and asylum seekers a more positive experience of our cities and towns and everything they have to offer. It is a chance for refugees to practise their English with a native (or at least fluent) English speaker, to learn more about British culture and traditions and to participate in English life.

A good way to look at it is to see your befriendee as your city or town's "guest" and you as their local "host". Even people who have been in the UK a decade or more have experienced very little of what Britain has to offer.

If you are interested please complete our online application process https://www.hostnation.org.uk/befriend

Skills


We are looking for open-minded, welcoming individuals with a desire to promote social inclusion. Experience supporting vulnerable people or refugees is a bonus, but is not mandatory. The most important thing is a friendly character and enthusiasm to share the city and region with a new friend.

We are looking for one or more volunteers to set up a digital photo library for use across the Bailiffgate Museum &amp; Gallery.

Many photos are currently held by individual volunteers on their own personal devices or scattered across various devices within Bailiffgate. A new photo library would:
● Bring together all the photographs that are currently stored in several locations
● Record descriptions of each photograph
● Ensure it is clear what permissions are in place
● Credit photographers as needed
● Enable tagging to facilitate easy searching
● Be available to a number of different users (e.g., marketing and social media volunteers, grant fundraising volunteers for evaluation, etc.)

Please note that this will not include photographic images from our historical collection unless they are intended for promotional use.

As you will have privileged access to our images, you will be asked to sign a confidentiality statement to say you will not share them outside of the Bailiffgate community.

Skills

● Proven media skills preferred and familiarity with an appropriate photo library platform (e.g., Flickr etc).
● You will need to have access to your own computer with a reliable internet connection for the transfer of large image files.
● An added bonus would be a volunteer that can also provide advice on simple photo editing, cropping and selection to help us make the best use of photographs to promote our museum.

MyBigCareer believes that every individual should have the opportunity to pursue their educational or employment aspirations, regardless of their background. We also believe in a stronger society where all areas of life are more fairly represented by our population. MyBigCareer connects young people with opportunities where they are supported and inspired to become positive change makers in their own lives.    We are recruiting motivated and enthusiastic individuals who are passionate about tackling inequality, to deliver 1:1 Coaching Sessions online to students. These sessions will take place during the school day so you must be able to offer around 2 hours at a time during the working day. The charity will provide you with a 3-hour online training with further significant help and resources to support volunteers, but the important requirements for the role are the ability to listen, show compassion and find a solution focussed approach. We are flexible as to the hours that you volunteer; the volunteering opportunities are on an event-by-event basis.    What you will be doing:  - Provide 1:1 support to students aged 12 to 15 from the most disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds.  - Listen to students, demonstrating compassion, recognising their uniqueness and potential, and so empowering them to achieve their own aspirations and to dream big.  -  Demonstrate passion, positivity and commitment to improving social mobility for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Skills



● You agree for us to conduct criminal background checks and have an Enhanced DBS certificate processed - Please note that to be eligible for an Enhanced DBS check and therefore for this role, all volunteers must have been living in the UK  for at least the last 3 years.
● You're available to attend a 3-hour online training
● You can provide us with 2 character references, before you can deliver any 1:1 sessions with a young person.  You must provide us with the name and contact details of 2 people who can act as referees for you.

In this workshop we look at Our nation by identifying various items and landmarks throughout England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

We introduce some typical UK families, looking at the jobs of the family members and explain the skills required for such roles.

Next, we complete an exercise in budgeting for a community event (a barbecue) using UK sourced products.

Lastly, we examine ways of looking after the environment and discuss how Businesses have a responsibility to reduce their impact in this area.

“Very Informative, relevant and useful for the children. Very engaging. Children were enthused and motivated. They all understood the task and worked brilliantly together. Excellent base on which teachers can build on to expand the knowledge and skills of the children. A fun and exciting day” - Emma Bennet Head of year 5 Meadowdale Academy in Bedlington

As a volunteer for this programme, we start off by watching a short video looking at the countries that make up Our Nation. Then we play the landmark game which is again like the pairs game, but they are matching words and pictures. Please share if you have been to any of the landmarks or took part in any of the events on the video. – Irish dancing. Welsh choir, tossing the caber etc

They must label all the landmarks in their books.

Then the families are introduced, and we look at the jobs of family members and we discuss what employers look for when they are looking for new employees. Share with them what you wanted to do as we play a skillset game. This game had 10 jobs and 50 skills. They must match by taking turns what skills are need for which jobs

Then we talk about the skills in more details.

They choose a job and write down in the books what skills they need for that chosen job.

Share with them the skills you need for your job We then look at employability soft skills. i.e., communication, teamwork etc What skills do they need to organise a community BBQ?

They are going to get a family and a budget and depending how many family members they have determines how much budget they have. They must work out what item they want to buy for the BBQ, but they must make sure they take food for the whole family, and some may have a tight budget so they must look at where they can get what. Basically, they are shopping.

They then draw what is going to be on their plate at the BBQ. In the afternoon we look at the environment and how businesses can help the environment.

They are going to set up a business making wooden bead bracelets and selling them to different customers. This is where you will become the customers. They must haggle with you to get the best price for their completed bracelets.

Along the way prices change due to supply and demand and BREXIT

To finish off they must look at what employability skills they have developed during the day and give examples

Skills

We look at what urban life is. Who is responsible for deciding which buildings go where in a city? Families that are moving to the city and their reasons for doing so are explained.

The advantages and disadvantages of Urban Life are discussed, and students partake in a “Cost of Living “board game.

The children are then asked to look at ways of raising funds for a local homeless shelter

“An excellent, interactive day designed to give children an insight and understanding about urban living. Clearly explained and delivered at an appropriate pace” Jason Abbott—Mill Lane Primary Stockton

As a volunteer you will be helping them design a city in their books. We then look at other cities around the world. Tell the children where you have lived? Which cities? Do you like living in a city?

We then go on to introduce the families and play the estate agent game matching a house with a family and then putting a price on the houses. What is your house? Is it detached, semi-detached a bungalow?

Then we look at the advantages and disadvantages of living in a city. Share your thoughts on this with the children whilst you play a game. The game is matching the words or phrases under the correct headings. One of the disadvantages is the cost of living is higher, so we play the cost-of-living board game. Each child will represent one of the families and they must work their way around the board paying their bills before they can have a reward like going to the cinema etc. Only if you wish you can share your experiences of managing your money

One of the implications of not paying your bills could be that you are made homeless so in the afternoon they are going to come up with a business idea and raise some money at the school fair.

We get them to imagine that they are going to have a stall at the school fair selling their products so we get them to think of ideas that are not going to cost a lot of money, but which can make a good profit.

They design their product and come up with a poster advertising the school fair. When they do their presentations as a volunteer you will become a panel of judges judging their presentations. (Dragons DEN)

In this programme we explore the World around us by identifying countries in varying states of economic development.

We meet families that are having to cope with financial restraints through careful budgeting. Lastly, we look at the impact of global trade and at Businesses that need to be redeveloped to prevent them going out of Business.

As a volunteer you will work with a group of 5 or 6 children.

We are going to start off by exploring the world. Where have you travelled in the world? We then watch a video and do a quiz testing their observation skills.

They are then introduced to the families, and they are going to budget a holiday. There are 6 destinations which they are introduced to, so they get a little information about the destinations that are available. They are going to be travel agents!!!

They have unlimited amount of money to start with but their choices depend on the results of a spinner so they could be going to Kenya for 7 days or Spain for 1.

They all get a different family, so they must budget the family holiday. Once they have budgeted their holiday, I give them a budget which could be a lot more or it could be a lot less, so they must budget again but without the spinner.

Help will be needed with their calculations at this point. Again, share your holiday experiences. They then match which currency they will need for which destination

Then we play a trading game where they are going to represent one of the 6 destinations and they are going to set up a business selling good quality shapes to sell to the UK.

This is where you will become either a shop keeper, bank manager or quality control and we need someone to police the game so rewards for good teamwork but fines for arguing etc.

Good fun but you must be careful with this as some people may choose to play on getting fines!!!

After lunch we get them to continue with the business theme and they get a business that they must revamp so you will assist them with their ideas, and they present their advertisement back and you will judge the presentations.

As a volunteer, you will be assisting a Primary Enterprise World Manager with the delivery of fun interactive workshops developing the children's life skills. The workshops will last for 1 day so timings you would expect to be at the school are 8.30 am - 3.00pm.

We look at the importance of family life and identify different families and look at their needs and wants and how to achieve them.

Pupils are introduced to budgeting and savings and where to keep money safe

“Great interactive activities that were well paced and pitched at the appropriate level. Money activities got children thinking about keeping money safe and paying for items which children find difficult to understand. Activities were useful to develop thinking skills” –Jackie Needham. Dame Allan’s Junior School Newcastle

The children all get a workbook to complete on the day.

As a volunteer you will work with a group of 5 or 6 children, so we start off by looking at what a family is, introduce your family and then the children get to draw their family. (Understanding their stick men drawings requires certain skills!!!)

Then I introduce the children to 6 families, and we look at jobs of the family members. We then play a guess who game which is a bit like catchphrase where they must answer a question to remove a square on the board and try and guess who is behind it.

The children take turns to pretend they are the person behind the squares, and they answer the questions.

We then look at Needs and wants and help them understand the difference, so we play a stand-up sit - down quiz looking at 10 pictures.

Then one of the families is going to Scotland camping in the middle of nowhere. Have you been camping? If so, please share with them. They must circle 5 things that the family need to survive their camping trips.

Understanding that there is no electricity, and no mobile signal is interesting.

We then see what the class have decided are the top 5.

The next session looks at one of the children from the families is having a birthday, so he gets £5.00 we look at what to do with his money apart from spending it!!!!

Saving—what are you saving for if anything? giving money to charity– Have you donated to any charities?

Then we look at options for a new bike as the child wants a bike but can’t afford it so how can he get money? Doing Chores!!!!! That’s an interesting one. Then we look at saving and we play the “where to keep money safe” which is a card game where you have 2 headers, and you must put the correct pictures under the correct header.

They are then designing money boxes. Did you have a money box? What was it like?

We then introduce them to map-reading, and they must allocate buildings on a map on an interactive board at the front and then some family members require certain items so where would they get say a meal out?

That’s the morning over!

In the afternoon we are going to raise some money for the elderly by having a teddy bears picnic. So first a story is told of how the children from the families are helping the elderly in the community by having a teddy bears picnic at their school.

The children in the class are going to help raise spending money for the elderly couple by colouring in teddy bears, cutting them out (bearing in mind they are 6) and then sticking them on a poster.

We want good quality teddy bears so if they are not, we send them back to try a bit harder.

For every good quality one they do they put a coin in the jar on the screen.

Aim of the game is to educate them about business but also to work as a team and resilience to keep trying

At Safe Families, we believe that no one should feel alone, and everyone deserves to belong. The Family Friend volunteer role is therefore a crucial role: we connect local volunteers with isolated families where the volunteer offers hope, support and belonging

Family Friends can volunteer with parents, children, or young people, depending on the volunteer's preferences
● It may involve taking a child who's being bullied to the beach for a couple of hours to show them they are valued
● being a listening ear to a mum who feels as though everyone is judging her
● Or it could be helping a dad with budgeting skills

We get to know all our volunteers and match them to a family that compliment's the volunteer's skills, experiences and preferences

Support usually takes place on a fortnightly basis for 3-6 months

Skills

● No formal experience or qualifications are necessary
● We are looking for volunteers that have a heart for helping people, are good listeners and can be empathic
● Some experience of looking after children (no matter how informal) will be of use
● We train and equip all our volunteers so they feel empowered and confident to offer support to isolated families

Introduction

The Nepacs youth project is funded by Children in Need, alongside various trusts and community funds from across the north east. The project aims to support young people aged from 8 to 17 years old who have been affected by the impact of having a loved one in prison. A young person may have experienced trauma and feelings of abandonment or become a victim of bullying. As a result, they can become isolated form their peers and struggle to communicate their thoughts and feelings around their own ‘hidden’ sentence. This is where the youth project can step in, to guide young people and offer support and advice to help them to feel positive and more confident about their future.

Overview of the role

Volunteers in this role will provide support, guidance and information to young people who are affected by the imprisonment of a family member. This role will be carried out within prison visitor centres, prison visits halls and through off-site external trips and residentials. Throughout your role, you will be assisted by youth workers, youth project coordinator and sessional staff and will not be expected to take on the sole responsibility for any activities or sessions you do not feel comfortable leading. However, if you feel you would like take on a position with increased responsibility as your volunteering progresses, the youth project coordinator can discuss the opportunities for you to do so, as and where required

Role Description

This youth project volunteer role has different responsibilities attached to it depending on the location you chose to work in and where you feel most comfortable supporting young people. If you would like to take on one or more volunteering roles then this will allow us to provide you with a broader range of experiences and opportunities to help you develop your skills and confidence.

Main tasks will include:
● Attending 1:1 engagement sessions with young people within schools / colleges
● Creating a supportive, non-judgmental environment for young people where they can discuss any issues they are experiencing in relation to their loved one being in prison
● Keeping accurate case notes and outcomes from each of the meeting/s to feedback to referral services, teachers and youth project coordinator where required
● Encouraging young people to form peer support networks with one another
● Adhering to Nepacs code of conduct, policies and safeguarding procedures

Skills

● Passion for supporting children and young people
● Friendly and approachable demeanour
● Strong interpersonal and diplomacy skills
● Empathy towards young people experience difficult circumstances
● Confidence
● Proactive attitude to help out other volunteers and staff where required

Introduction

The Nepacs youth project is funded by Children in Need, alongside various trusts and community funds from across the north east. The project aims to support young people aged from 8 to 17 years old who have been affected by the impact of having a loved one in prison. A young person may have experienced trauma and feelings of abandonment or become a victim of bullying. As a result, they can become isolated form their peers and struggle to communicate their thoughts and feelings around their own ‘hidden’ sentence. This is where the youth project can step in, to guide young people and offer support and advice to help them to feel positive and more confident about their future.

Overview of the role

Volunteers in this role will provide support, guidance and information to young people who are affected by the imprisonment of a family member. This role will be carried out within prison visitor centres, prison visits halls and through off-site external trips and residentials. Throughout your role, you will be assisted by youth workers, youth project coordinator and sessional staff and will not be expected to take on the sole responsibility for any activities or sessions you do not feel comfortable leading. However, if you feel you would like take on a position with increased responsibility as your volunteering progresses, the youth project coordinator can discuss the opportunities for you to do so, as and where required

Role Description

This youth project volunteer role has different responsibilities attached to it depending on the location you chose to work in and where you feel most comfortable supporting young people. If you would like to take on one or more volunteering roles then this will allow us to provide you with a broader range of experiences and opportunities to help you develop your skills and confidence.

Main tasks will include:
● Attending prison family days which bring young people and their relative in prison together for a longer visit (which Nepacs staff and volunteers facilitate)
● Creating a positive and welcoming atmosphere for young people during the visit
● Delivering appropriate activities for young people which support members of the family and their loved one who is in prison to bond
● Connecting with young people and their families across the day to enhance their experience of the family day visit

Skills

● Passion for supporting children and young people
● Friendly and approachable demeanour
● Strong interpersonal and diplomacy skills
● Empathy towards young people experience difficult circumstances
● Confidence
● Proactive attitude to help out other volunteers and staff where required

The Nepacs North East helpline is part of our new Early Days in Custody project which supports prisoners and their families in the first few weeks of imprisonment. The helpline number will be advertised across the region so that family members or friends affected by imprisonment know they have a place they can call with their questions and concerns.

Ideally, as part of the role we would encourage volunteers to help within a Durham Nepacs project, for example Support at Courts or Family Prison Visits. This will enable volunteers to understand the journey of the family members/significant others and the situations they encounter as they navigate their way through the criminal justice system.

Main tasks include:
● To provide emotional support and information to families / significant others via telephone, email or text
● Make telephone calls to family members/significant others ahead of their first visit to a prison to explain the visiting process, answer questions and address concerns/worries
● Answer phone calls to the helpline and offer information and support to alleviate some of the distress and confusion experienced by family members/significant others when their loved one is first sent into prison
● Record all calls in line with our recording and monitoring processes
● Raise any causes for concern and follow the safeguarding process when necessary
● Volunteer with a Nepacs project on a fortnightly basis (optional but recommended)

Skills

● Excellent listening and verbal communication skills
● Good writing skills
● Ability to maintain confidentiality at all times
● To be able to actively listen without prejudice
● Awareness of your own emotional triggers and can cope with your own feelings
● Ability to deal sensitively with all callers, including vulnerable people, those with mental health issues and children, as necessary
● Understand and demonstrate Nepacs values: Welcoming, Respectful, Supportive, Positive and Trustworthy

This opportunity is for volunteer facilitators at our lovely group in Whitley Bay. Peer Talk supports people (18 plus) who are living through anxiety, depression and associated feelings. We look for a minimum commitment of 12-18 months and you would expect to facilitate on our rota system for 4 or 5 meetings in a 13 week period. Our meetings last for 90 minutes.

You really don't need experience as such. Experience of life is more important. You will actively listen and be able to signpost our peers to possible additional help/support. Our peers come from a cross section of our local community and many will return week after week. We have no waiting lists-our peers can simply turn up.

Facilitator duties at the meeting
● To arrive 20 minutes prior to the Support Group meeting time.
● To prepare the room for the meeting
● To engage in pre brief with co facilitator
● To meet and greet new and regular attendees
● To check that new people are at the right meeting and to introduce them to the rest of the group
● To begin and close the meeting punctually
● To facilitate the meeting according to the training given
● To debrief with the other Facilitator after closing the meeting
● To complete attendance statistics on a weekly basis
● To keep a record and receipts of expenses incurred in your role as a Support Group Facilitator and to send your completed expenses form to the PeerTalk office
● To ensure the meeting room is left as you found it

Skills


The volunteers are not mental health counsellors, but great listeners. Qualities we are looking for:

Empathy, enthusiasm, compassion, good communication/ personal skills, patience &amp; mutual respect

Commitment

The minimum suggested volunteer time commitment with the support group is 18 months, following the initial training. Additionally, we invite our volunteers to attend a meeting every 8 weeks for mutual support and to receive ongoing training. We may offer other training opportunities, which will be optional.

Person description

The sustainability of a PeerTalk Support Group depends on the commitment, personal qualities and enthusiasm of the people who volunteer as Facilitators.

These personal qualities include:
● Being a good listener.
● Being able to show compassion and empathy.
● Being non judgemental.
● Having common sense.
● Having a strong sense of commitment.
● Being able to present balanced viewpoints.
● Having a willingness to learn.
● Having a sense of humour.
● Being able to keep a confidence.
● Having good communication skills.
● Being respectful of others.
● Having enthusiasm for this area of mental health and for the work of PeerTalk.
● Being a good team player.
● Being a person of integrity.

Expectation for WaterAid Speakers:
● Deliver a minimum of four talks or workshops per year, either online and/or face to face

● Immediately after the visit: The Speaker will ask for any immediate feedback and let the audience know to expect an email later for online feedback
● Shortly after the visit: The Speaker will email the audience as a thank you and include the audience feedback survey link. The Speaker will fill in their own feedback survey regarding the visit. Any surprises, changes or challenges on the day are emailed to Speakers@wateraid.org. Finally, the Speaker will delete any contact details or sensitive information from their records.

Skills

The role of the short-term dog care volunteer is to help our training and supply team by providing temporary homes for our young dogs whilst they are spending their first 12 - 16 months with a full-time volunteer puppy trainer.

As a short-term volunteer, you will be required to take on a puppy and have him or her living in your home for up to 4 weeks at a time.

You must have the time and commitment needed, and be physically able to provide basic obedience training, socialisation and the appropriate exercise required for a young dog.

Although you are not required to train the puppy to the same level and intensity of our fulltime volunteers, you will be asked to keep up the dog’s good behaviour, attend any prescheduled daytime puppy classes, as well as follow any welfare and training plans in place. You will receive all the required support, coaching and guidance from a member of our training and/or welfare team whilst the puppy or dog is in your care.

What’s involved?
● To provide a short-term, safe and loving home to one of our young dogs in training.
● To train, exercise and feed the puppy or dog as instructed by your training instructor and/or welfare advisor.
● To proactively reply to holiday requests and inform us of your availability.

● Our puppies require a lot of attention and adequate time is required to dedicate to continuing their training on a daily basis. You must be at home for most of the day, therefore we cannot consider your application if you work full time, even if you work from home. Part-time workers may occasionally be considered on an individual basis (e.g. if you work very few hours from home).

● Generally other pets in the household are fine. Pet dogs (no more than 2, and to be over 12 months in age) will need to be behaviourally assessed for suitability. Pet dogs are not able to attend our weekly puppy classes, group walks, nor any other training sessions so would need to be left at home during these times.

Volunteer Puppy Training involves looking after and caring for one of our puppies or young dogs on a full-time basis, in your own home. Depending on your location, preferences, and the puppy itself this could be from anywhere between 6-18 months at a time so requires a great deal of commitment.

Volunteer Puppy Training covers three main types of training scheme at Hearing Dogs.

These are as follows:

Puppy training – taking care of a puppy from the age of 8 weeks for approximately 12- 14 months, attending regular classes and introducing it to the wider world. When the puppy is ready it will begin its advanced sound work training either at one of our training centres or in another volunteer’s home. This role suits non-workers.

Training from home – looking after one of our adolescent dogs, usually for 6-8 months at a time and allowing a Hearing Dogs dog trainer either into your home to carry out training or to pick up the dog &amp; take them for training elsewhere. This is ideal for those who would prefer an older puppy.

Volunteer dog training – incorporates both of the above roles. You would care for a puppy through its entire training from 8 weeks of age to placement with a deaf partner.

This is ideal for those who have an interest in dog training and are keen to get involved with the advanced training of our hearing dogs.

When you apply for Volunteer Puppy Training you can discuss the options and your preferences with our Volunteering Team, as well as the dog trainer who carries out your home visit to decide which scheme might suit you and us the best
● To provide a safe and loving home to one of our puppies or adolescent dogs, and to offer consistent care on a daily basis. N.B. Puppies cannot be left alone for longer than an hour and older dogs cannot be left on a regular basis and for no longer than 2-3 hours.
● To attend weekly puppy classes either in person locally or online using Microsoft Teams as and when required. You may also be expected to attend additional group training sessions at The Grange in Buckinghamshire or the Beatrice Wright Centre in York.
● To develop and/or keep up basic obedience and good behaviour, as well as following specific ‘Hearing Dogs’ training instructions as advised by your dog trainer.
● To exercise and feed the dog as instructed by the training and canine healthcare staff.
● To bring the dog to one of our training centres as and when required for assessments, grooming and health checks. N.B. Alternatives are in place for those living a long way from our centres.
● To allow one of our dog trainers to visit regularly (while you are there) to see the puppy in its home environment and to carry out training if training from home.
● Please note that puppies are gradually introduced to new environments dependent on where they are up to in their training. Whilst we encourage them to be taken out into a variety of environments, your trainer will advise you on an individual basis.

May we politely ask that you think carefully about your availability before applying to be a volunteer and thereby engaging charity time and money. We ask for a commitment of at least 1 year for all dog care roles so if you have any major foreseen life changes on the horizon (e.g. moving house, getting a pet dog, new job, pregnancy) then it'd be preferable get back in touch when your circumstances are more settled please.

Skills

● A stable and loving home, with a safe, secure garden that is directly accessible from your house.
● Adequate time to dedicate to training a young dog on a daily basis. We cannot consider your application if you work full time, even if you work from home. Part time workers may occasionally be considered on an individual basis (e.g. if you work very few hours from home).
● Volunteers who can drive and own a suitable vehicle (i.e. one that can transport a puppy or dog safely) in order to be able to attend puppy classes, for training purposes and in the case of emergencies.
● Volunteers who have access to email and video calling facilities for online training.
● Generally other pets in the household are fine. Pet dogs (no more than 2) will need to be behaviourally assessed for suitability. Pet dogs are not able to attend our weekly puppy classes, group walks, nor any other training sessions so would need to be left at home during these times.
● A non-smoking household is needed, however outside-only smoking is fine. Vape smoking is also strongly recommended to be outside your property only.

This programme helps children to understand what goes on in a neighbourhood by looking at the factors that are involved in budgeting for and building their dream home.

This is followed by examining how their new home becomes part of the wider community.

“The pupils really enjoyed their enterprise day, they found the challenges fun and engaging” - Mrs Rooney - Scremerston First School

As a volunteer we start off by looking at what neighbourhood life is? We are looking to concentrate on 3 things that happen in a neighbourhood – Living, working and socialising.

We ask them what goes on in their neighbourhood. Tell them about your neighbourhood We are then looking at living in a neighbourhood, so we need a house.

They are going to be given a budget of £150.000.00 to design and build as a group 1 house.

Get them to think carefully about what they want. Tell them about your house.

They build their house and then must show their calculations.

How many pieces of brick did they buy? How many windows etc. They may need help at this point

Then we play a game matching picture with words so looking at all the jobs that are involved from start to finish in building a house. Bit like the pairs game in cards if you have ever played that.

Then we look at the families and look at the jobs of family members. Tell them what you do.

Some are government workers some are not, so we play a quiz stand up sit down looking at different jobs. Then they are going to be allocated a government job and they work as a group to come up with as many reasons why they need that government worker. Help will be needed at this point

This will get a little debate going as to which one is the most important.

In the afternoon the local café is looking for the children’s help so they must design and present a new product that will help the local café boost business. Your assistance to help them understand that it is not what they want but that they must think about customers in their neighbourhood. They come up with the idea, design the recipe and a poster and present back to the class and then we do a vote for which one is the best idea

Skills

● You do not need any specific skills or experience but it may help if you have worked with children before but not essential
● Some schools insist on a criminal records check so this will be needed which Primary Enterprise World will do if you don't currently have one in place

We are looking for people aged 25+ to drive our 12 seater minibus for either a morning or afternoon once or twice a month. All drivers must have a clean licence to comply with the terms of the insurance for the minibus.

We are a small independent charity that has existed for 30 years, initially set up to provide trips to local libraries for elderly and / or disable people in Gosforth and surrounding area. We still do this but also run shopping trips to local supermarkets and community groups can hire the minibus for half or full day trips to places of interest.

Some drivers do a regular trip each month, others just cover trips when people are on holiday if they are available. We sometimes have one off bookings from local organsations and an e mail request is sent to all drivers who respond if they can help.

The people who use the services we provide very much appreciate getting out and about. Our current team of drivers have been with us for 6-8 years, some longer they are getting older and we need to find more.

Skills

● Clean, valid driving licence required (ideally D1 category, but not essential)
● Experience with larger vehicles preferred
● Good communication skills
● Enthusiasm and patience

Volunteering with us is a great way to spend time outdoors, meet new people and course, improve the river.

Our conservation volunteers are vital to the Trust and carry out practical tasks that improve habitat and make the river a better place to be.

Tackle Invasive Species
● Himalayan Balsam is an invasive plant that dominates our riverbanks. Due its short roots, its presence results in riverbank erosion. Removing this invasive plants allows native species to colonise and stabilise the riverbank.

Debris Clearance
● Often after a storm event our paths are covered in flood debris, resulting in new paths being formed. This causes further habitat disturbance. Our work to clear debris means that members of the public can remain on footpaths and protect the surrounding habitat.

Restoring Riverbanks
● Willow spiling is a traditional natural method of controlling bank erosion. Through weaving live willow rods between live willow posts, the bank behind is filled with sediments for the willow to root into and stabilise the bank.

Tree Planting
● Tree planting is an important part of our year. Through increasing tree cover, we reduce flood risk throughout the catchment whilst providing shade for our fish during the hotter months, the provision of woody debris also benefits invertebrates, which in turn supplies food for fish.

Skills

● Although you don't need formal training or experience to be a TRT volunteer you do need a level of physical ability as most tasks are practical and invlolve, lifting, carrying and walking of some description. The ground is often uneven in areas where we work and volunteers must tell us if they have any medical needs, allergies etc.
● We work in all weathers, rain or shine and so volunteers must come dressed for the weather and provide their own lunch, sunscreen, insect repellent and sturdy shoes etc
● The volunteer day usually does not exceed 4 or 5 hours depending on where we are working and what the task is. We do expect individuals to work as a team while out on task, we have a lovely group of like minded people.

School governors help to shape school policies and aims, allowing teachers to focus on delivering high-quality educational experiences.

Effective governance can positively impact a child’s experience of education.

Over a third of schools in England have one or more vacancies on their governing boards, leaving them without the skills needed to make the right decisions.

The governor role is strategic rather than operational.

Governors don’t get involved with the day to day running of a school, instead supporting and challenging the school’s leadership team to drive school improvement.

Governors usually attend around 6 meetings a year.

Being a school governor is a commitment and a responsibility, but offers you the chance to see first-hand the impact you can make in improving education for children in your community.

• Planning the strategic direction of the school

• Overseeing financial performance of the school and ensuring money is well spent

• Holding the headteacher or school leadership to account

Apply to become a governor by completing our online form via: www.governorsforschools.org.uk

First, tell us about the skills and expertise you could bring to a school. Then, we’ll assign you a dedicated partnership manager to guide you through the placement process.

We’ll match your skillset to a school in need, so you can be sure you’re having a positive impact and making a difference to children.

The majority of our volunteers are first-time governors without any previous education experience. Often, this outside perspective can drive effective change in schools.

However, we know joining a board can feel daunting.

We’ve developed eLearning modules on a number of topics to help you get up to speed on key elements of the role.

We also hold regular webinars so you can continue your learning and have the opportunity to ask questions.

New governors receive exclusive access to guidance and resources.

You’ll receive 12 months’ free access to online governor resource and knowledge bank The Key – so you can be confident in your decision making.

Skills

● Excellent communication skills
● Ability to effectively challenge
● Commitment and enthusiasm Interest in education and supporting schools and pupils reach their potential
● School boards need diverse skillsets and community representation to operate at their best so a range of skills, experiences and background are very welcome

You and your special dog could make a huge difference to the lives of older dog lovers in your community by becoming a "Visiting Wag Team"

We are the only visiting dogs charity befriending older dog lovers in their own homes as well as in care or in hospitals

Many of our elderly friends are bereaved and isolated and miss the company of a dog. It only takes an hour or two most weeks for a chat and a furry cuddle, to make a difference
● Your dog must be at least 18 months old, have a good temperament and level of behaviour and enjoy being handled

Most Wag Friendship Dogs are normal cuddle monsters not obedience champions, but obviously it's important they are under control and pass our assessment. To see if your dog would enjoy volunteering, why not take a look at our "suitabiity and assessment criteria"

You must have had your dog for at least 6 months, feed dog food or cooked - rather than raw - meat and be happy to follow our "veterinary guidelines" which comply with national standards for visiting dogs

Skills

● Be over 18
● Be the dog owner
● Be prepared for your dog to under go and pass assessment
● Be flexible to support the person/s you are selected to visit

A Caseworker is someone who carries out welfare work for the Royal Air Forces Association. Welfare work is about listening to an individual and assessing their needs to find out how the Organisation can provide help and support to them.

Support can include anything from:
● Helping put a client with a disability in touch with social services, so they can apply for funding for a wet room
● Something as simple as filling in a form to get a new fridge, for a client who cannot afford to replace their broken one
● It could also be informing clients of the holiday breaks the Association offers in one of its three Wings Break hotels

Caseworkers may also need to gather complex information on beneficiaries to help with applications for care home fees or similar and this can involve providing clear and precise information on finances and correspondences. Caseworkers work with "clients" who are members of the RAF family.

The caseworker will:
● Visit potential beneficiaries, listen to their concerns and asses their needs
● Identify areas of support and make referrals to partner agencies as required
● Record visits and maintain good records of activities, recommendations and actions
● Electronically record requests for help on the Case Management System (Form A) for which training is provided
● Undertake follow up visits as required
● Provide regular updates to the AWO
● Complete monthly returns cataloguing their activity

Skills

● Experience of welfare work
● Listening skills and asking pertinent questions
● Communication skills
● IT skills
● Report writing skills
● Building relationships with a wide variety of people
● Research skills (in terms of finding out local area information about social services, hospital services, local council information, other charity support on offer, etc.)
● Team working skills

You would be expected to provide one to one support to vulnerable young people aged 6 – 25 years old who are at risk of offending or furthering offending, but who is ready to engage in mentoring support.

You would be assigned one young person based on personality and interests, and would be expected to meet with them weekly for up to a year. In place of holidays and sickness, the worker will provide support instead. The focus is on the conversation to challenge, guide and empower young people to make better choices.

The mentoring meetings are based in the young persons community so we would match you where you’re comfortable and willing to travel. Your mentor meetings are arranged between yourself and your young person around both your existing commitments such as school and work, and can take place any day Monday to Saturday.



Skills

● No qualifications or previous experience necessary but you should feel comfortable to work independently. We complete 8 weeks of training to cover important topics such as safeguarding and youth work principles.
● You are provided with a small budget for refreshments with expenses and travel costs being reimbursed.
● We recognise that some people who have had involvement with the police in their past but have worked hard to move away from crime are motivated to help similar young people and therefore we look at previous offences you may have on an individual basis. You must have had a settled period for at least 2 years.

Are you a dog lover? Do you have some spare time? Would you like to make a difference to someone's life? If you've answered yes to these questions, then this role could be perfect for you!

As a Puppy Raiser, you'll provide a puppy with the vital foundation for its future role as a guide dog. You'll be looking after a puppy for 12-16 months and will guide him or her through training, socialisation, the introduction of new environments and experiences whilst providing a loving home.

There might be the odd chewed slipper along the way, but nothing beats the rewarding feeling of loving and raising a puppy who will go on to make an enormous difference to someone living with sight loss.

What you'll be doing:
● Engaging with our world-class Puppy Raising for Excellent Partnerships (PREP) training programme to prepare your puppy for the next stages of becoming a guide dog
● Providing care and support for your puppy at home e.g., loving, grooming and feeding him or her
● Socialising your puppy and introducing him or her to a variety of environments to increase confidence – this can be as simple as taking your puppy with you to the shops, office or park as you go about your everyday life
● Teaching your puppy to be comfortable alone - gradually building up from a few minutes to a maximum of four hours
● Taking your puppy to monthly puppy classes, and interacting with other puppy raisers in your community whilst refreshing your training and sharing tips
● Meeting with your volunteer manager as frequently as needed to discuss any changes or issues with your puppy
● Completing short questionnaires about your puppy’s development

Skills

● A loving home with enough time to invest in raising a puppy
● Someone at home who is physically able to handle large breed dogs (around 25-40kg)
● Access to a car, so that you can get your puppy used to travelling
● The agreement of your landlord to have a dog in the property if you rent your home
● A safe secure area outside for your puppy to go to the toilet

At the heart of guiding are the unit meetings that girls go along to regularly. Volunteering at unit meetings means getting stuck in, meeting new people and running activities that help girls know they can do anything.

Unit meetings are usually once a week for around an hour.

Roles include:



Unit helper

These roles are perfect for you if you can’t give time every week, want to help casually or are keen to share a specific skill or passion. This can be anything from camping or football through to photography or managing a shop!
● Helpers are vital in enabling the unit to keep running. They help out either on a rota system, or just whenever they can, providing the Leaders with an extra pair of hands

Our tea party drivers are a vital part of the Re-engage team.

Tea parties provide a lifeline of friendship for our older people, and the regular, warm, friendly chats and companionship provide a vital link with the outside world from which they have become isolated. Drivers take older people to the parties and stay with them to enjoy the get-together. Over time, drivers and older guests get to know each other well and together you will spend many hours full of fun, laughter, and stories.

As a tea party driver, you liaise with your group coordinator and take older guests to and from the tea parties each month. Staying at the tea party is part of your role, so it's much more than being a driver.

You will need access to a full, clean driving licence, a DBS (England and Wales) or PVG (Scotland), and you must inform your insurance company that you're driving on behalf of Re-engage for this role.

Tasks include:
● Driving one to two older guests using your own car to a tea party venue and returning them home again after the event
● Staying at the tea party to help with conversation and serve refreshments
● Liaising with the group coordinator to confirm which older guests you will pick up
● Informing the group coordinator of any safeguarding concerns or Issues you might have
● Following all guidance in your driver training modules to ensure that the tea parties are enjoyable, appropriate, and in line with our charitable aims

Skills

● Organised
● Good conversational skills
● Considerate driving ability
● Ability to navigate to new addresses
● A friendly, and empathetic approach
● Patience and understanding of supporting older people
● Basic computer literacy (including the ability to use emails)

Join our tunnel guide team leading tours in Victoria Tunnel – the number one thing to do in Newcastle on TripAdvisor.

Our guides run short 75-minute tours and longer 2-hour tours both for the public and private groups.

We focus on two key periods of the Tunnel’s history its beginning as a Victorian coal waggonway and its use as an air-raid shelter during World War II. Full training is provided in both content and delivery.

Tours are delivered by pairs of guides, and we support our volunteers to buddy up or to lead tours with a range of people, whichever suits them most.

There is also opportunity to get involved in leading tours for schools and supporting our special event programme – from Halloween and Christmas to stewarding music events and hosting Tipples in the Tunnel. Take a look at our website to see the full range.

The role involves
● Meeting and welcoming visitors (12-15 per tour) and checking booking list.
● Leading the tour to the Tunnel, 700m through the Tunnel and back to the entrance, explaining the history and heritage of the Victoria Tunnel and making a tour of it a wonderful fulfilling experience.
● Monitoring and observing the health and safety requirements of the tour.

Other responsibilities may include:
● Getting involved with our ‘rod squad’ to help maintain the tunnel
● Coming up with ideas and help organise events
● First Aid training

Training provided
● Volunteers are provided with a Guide Mentor and work with their mentor to complete our training programme. All materials are provided.
● We want guides to feel comfortable and confident both with the history and content of the tours, as well as how to deliver them. The duration of training is agreed on an individual case by case basis.
● Most of our trainee guides start by leading the welcome introduction, then adding different sections of the tour until they feel confident delivering everything themselves.

Time required

Guides volunteer usually for 2-3 hours at a time. Tours usually last 1¼ or 2 hours and run weekdays, evenings and weekends. Guides can lead tours regularly or occasionally, and willingness to step in at short notice is very much appreciated.

We hope to see Guides on tours at least once a month.

● An interest in history
● Experience of working with people
● Excellent communication and organisational skills
● The enthusiasm and the ability to work as part of a team.

The Nepacs youth project is funded by Children in Need, alongside various trusts and community funds from across the north east. The project aims to support young people aged from 8 to 17 years old who have been affected by the impact of having a loved one in prison. A young person may have experienced trauma and feelings of abandonment or become a victim of bullying. As a result, they can become isolated form their peers and struggle to communicate their thoughts and feelings around their own ‘hidden’ sentence.

However, if you feel you would like take on a position with increased responsibility as your volunteering progresses, the youth project coordinator can discuss the opportunities for you to do so, as and where required.

This youth project volunteer role has different responsibilities attached to it depending on the location you chose to work in and where you feel most comfortable supporting young people. If you would like to take on one or more volunteering roles then this will allow us to provide you with a broader range of experiences and opportunities to help you develop your skills and confidence.

Main tasks will include:
● Interacting with and supporting young people as they wait for their visit in prison
● Delivering sessions to ensure young people enjoy themselves and have an opportunity to talk to someone whilst they are within the youth zone
● Creating a friendly, welcoming, non-judgmental environment for all young people
● Signposting young people and their parents/carers into trips and residential activities
